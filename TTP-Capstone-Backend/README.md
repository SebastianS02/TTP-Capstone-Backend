Project Title

Sandwich Maker

Made for sandwich enthusiasts who may want to order their dream sandwich without having to leave their home.

Project Description
	
	On this website, the first thing you will be able to do is make an account and login. Once that is finished, you can either begin making a sandwich or look 
	
	at popular creations from other users. If you choose to make your own sandwich, you can choose any ingredient you want while building your sandwich, so long 
	
	as it exists in the website’s database. You can choose the bread type, what meat and veggies you may want, and so on. Once you are finished making your 
	
	sandwich, you can save it and it will permanently be stored in your account. If you would rather look at other user’s creations, you can check out the 
	
	“Popular Creations” section, which allows you to see what other users have made. 
	
	
	We used a variety of technologies to build this website. For starters, we used JWT, or JSON Web Tokens, to manage the register, login, and authentication 
	
	aspect of the website. We also used PERN, which stands for PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node, to manage the client and server of the website. 
	
	
	Making this website from scratch in about a week was no easy task. Not only did we have to apply concepts that were fairly new to us, but we had to teach 
	
	ourselves a few things as well, such as deploying the website with Heroku. There were a few concepts we had in mind that simply couldn’t be done in the 
	
	timeframe given, such as being able to order a sandwich to your home. We also wanted to include ratings for sandwiches, so users could give a 1-5 star 
	
	rating on sandwiches they viewed, as well as nutrition facts depending on what ingredients were in a certain sandwich. 

To run and use the project
  
  To run the project, you will need to pull this backend code and the front end code into their respective server and client-side folders. You will need to run the code on react, and from there you should have access to the website.
